            <p id="aname">Hi! I'm Abu Bakar Siddique</p>
            <hr>
            <p id="aDetails">
                A passionate Computer Science and Engineering student at American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB), I have always been fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software. My journey in technology began early, driven by a curiosity to explore how computing systems work and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Whether it is coding in C++, designing embedded systems using Arduino, or building robotic systems, my focus lies in creating innovative solutions that enhance processes and improve efficiency.
                <br><br>
                Throughout my academic career, I have worked on several impactful projects, including GovtAid, a freelancing platform built with C#, a Student Management System in Java, and various robotic systems for competitions. These projects have strengthened my expertise in both software development and hardware integration, allowing me to develop systems that are robust, functional, and user-friendly. My passion for IoT, Machine Learning, and Robotics continues to drive me toward learning and implementing cutting-edge technologies.
                <br><br>
                Beyond academics, I have been actively involved in university activities, serving as the In-Charge of the Office of Sports at AIUB, where I contributed to organizing and managing major sporting events, including AIUB internal tournaments and inter-university tournaments. Additionally, I am a General Member of the AIUB Computer Club, where I participate in tech-related events, workshops, and collaborative projects that broaden my technical knowledge.
                <br><br>
                I have also represented my university in robotics competitions, such as the Jahangirnagar University Science Club's 6th National Science Festival 2024 and the East West University Robo Fest, showcasing my skills in designing and programming soccer bots. My achievements include successfully developing automation systems like a football-carrying RC bot and a thief detection system using Arduino, reflecting my commitment to blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications.
                <br><br>
                With a strong interest in emerging technologies, I am dedicated to honing my expertise and contributing to innovative solutions in IoT, robotics, and data analytics. My ambition is to work on transformative projects that leverage software, hardware, and intelligent systems to solve complex real-world challenges.
